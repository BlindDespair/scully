# Scully Documentation (Alpha) 

## What is Scully?

**Scully** is freaking awesome, Why? because it creates static sites using Angular.
In other words, **Scully** is a SSG (static site generator) for Angular. 

### How does it do it?

 The magic happens thanks to its node CLI application. It allows you to use schematics for a simple work flow.
  
 Scully works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
